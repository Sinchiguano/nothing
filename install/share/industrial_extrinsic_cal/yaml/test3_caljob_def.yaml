#cost_type: FixedCircleTargetCameraReprjErrorPK
#Each observation in our scene consists of one camera, one target, and a region of interest.

#The selection of the appropriate cost type
#is the most difficult concept contained in this tutorial.
#In this case, we have a circle target in a fixed location who's points are in known locations relative to the target frame, and we are projecting the points into the camera's frame without a distortion model.
