current meaning has been defined by \font.

I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.

You might try inserting a different font spec;
e.g., type `I\font<same font id>=<substitute font name>'.

! Infinite glue shrinkage found in a paragraph.
l.1556 
       
The paragraph just ended includes some glue that has
infinite shrinkability, e.g., `\hskip 0pt minus 1fil'.
Such glue doesn't belong there---it allows a paragraph
of any length to fit on one line. But it's safe to proceed,
since the offensive shrinkability has been made finite.
