During the development of this thesis, I was very lucky to be surrounded by a lot of good experts in the field. The department where I ended up was a really interesting and motivating environment. All this I have to thank to Mr. Václav Hlaváč, my supervisor, who introduced me into the department and led me very good during my whole period I was at the faculty. So I would like to thank him in the first place. Second, I would like to thank all my colleagues at the department who were always ready to help me with everything. So hereby also special thanks to Vladimir Petrík, Vladimír Smutný, Valentýn Číhala, Ondřej Holešovský, Michal Vavrečka and Libor Wagner. They made me have a very good time there. And finally, I really want to thank my parents who are also always there for me, which was not different when I was in Prague, they motivated and supported me during my whole stay. So thank you all.\\\\
