\section{Motivation}

Recognizing and determining the 6D pose of an object (3D translation and 3D rotation) is necessary in order for robots to manipulate such objects. However, it is still a challenging problem for computer vision. In this master thesis we are interested in tackling the problem of determining the 3D pose by estimating it, giving as input, a RGB-D image and a 3D object model, which is created and it is required for pose estimation. In addition to, a robot-camera calibration(extrinsic calibration) needs to be solved first as well as the intrinsic parameters of the camera. The method does not deal with occlusion and overlapping transparent objects. It is mainly focus in an isolated object.


Existing research of 3D object recognition based on 3D data of an object, as a
3D model, often categorizes the approach in using either global or local feature
descriptors. Local descriptors describe a local region of the scene or of the 3D
model while global descriptors describe the whole of the object using only one
descriptor.
